Over the years, I have become an experienced lecturer on topics such as programming, software design, automated game design and software evolution.
In my teaching, two courses for I have especially enjoyed are the Bachelor course [Object Oriented Analysis and Design](/Assets/OOAD_BSc_course/OOAD_manual_1617.pdf) and the Master course [Software Evolution](/Assets/SE_MSc_course/SE_reader_2021.pdf).
