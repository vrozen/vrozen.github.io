Procedural level generation empowers level designers
with tools for generating game levels.
However, generating levels comes at the cost of level quality.
We investigate how to create better generators
and debuggers based on rewrite rules and blueprints.

**Ludoscope.** We study Ludoscope, a generator that has been developed and successfully applied in the Unexplored series by [Ludomotion](https://www.ludomotion.com).
In Ludoscope, level transformation pipelines step-by-steptransform level content, gradually adding detail, dungeons, enemies, encounters, missions, etc. These pipelines consist of grammar rules that work on content represented as tile maps, graphs, Voronoi Diagrams and Strings.

As part of our work on improving level generators,
we have proposed two techniques for improving grammars to generate better game levels [4].

* **MAD.** The first, Metric of Added Detail (MAD), leverages the intuition that grammar rulesgradually add detail, and uses a detail hierarchy that indicates for calculating the score of rule applications.

* **SAnR.** The second, Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR) proposes a language for specifying level properties, and analyzes level generation histories, showing how properties evolve over time.

The study of level generation has yielded several tool prototypes.

* **Ludoscope Lite.** Tool prototype for analysis of levels and generators by Quinten Heijn [1].
Based on Rascal and Salix, the prototype implements MAD and SAnR and demonstrates the techniques are feasible.
Ludoscope Lite is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/visknut/LudoscopeLite).

* **Ludoscope Mini.** Tool for debugging level generators by Georgia Samaritaki [5].
Also based on Rascal and Salix, its aims are to raise
the quality of level generators by improving debugging facilities.
Ludoscope Mini is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeorgiaSamaritaki/Ludoscope-Mini).

### Current and Future Work
**Mental Maps.** 
We propose bridging the gap between designing level schematics and generating game levels using templates called Mental Maps [5, 6, 7].

**Master projects and collaboration.**
As part of my work on Automated Game Design,
I am open to new projects and collaborations on Procedural Content Generation.
