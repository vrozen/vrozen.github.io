## Short Talks

### Talk 1: Procedural Generation Using Linear Constraints
**Abstract.** Procedural content generation problems sometimes involve systems of linear equality and inequality constraints among the elements being generated. Cassowary is a constraint solver designed for solving these types of constraints at interactive speeds. It is widely used in user interface toolkits, and multiple implementations are available. To date, Cassowary has not been used in procedural content generation. This talk presents Cassowary and gives examples of its use in procedural content generation.

### Talk 2: Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Modern Computer Games

**Abstract.** As the complexity of Modern Computer Games increases, the value of their Model-Based Design becomes apparent. By using most appropriate modelling formalisms, at appropriate levels of abstraction, by explicitly quantifying the notion of "playability", and by automatic exploration of the space of possible game designs (and in particular, of Non-Player Character behaviour), many alternatives can be explored virtually, and games can be synthesized. Some personal experiences with Model-Based Design of Modern Computer Games will be presented.

### Talk 3: Radical Content Generation
**Abstract.** Content generation in games offers many opportunities to push game design into new directions. The technology is available but the industry seems reluctant to apply it. What does it take to start making bigger strides? In this talk Joris discusses lessons learned from developing Unexplored and its sequel, mostly how state-of-the-art generative techniques pushes the envelope for game design.

<b>Speaker.</b> Joris Dormans is head of Ludomotion where he applies his latest research in Procedural Content Generation to the design and development of Unexplored 2: The Wayfarers Legacy. He is also a founder and adviser for <a href="http://machinations.io">Machination.io</a>, and assistant professor at Leiden University where he teaches courses in Game Studies, Critical Game Design, and Generative Narratology. His current design and research interests lie within the intersection of content generation, emergent gameplay, and player agency.

### Talk 4: It's a Wonderful Narrative World
**Abstract.**
A Narrative World comprises a number of interrelated locations that, all together, fully support enacting a given story. Each of these locations features not only all objects required there by the narrative, but also a variety of other objects that adequately describe or decorate the location. 
Procedurally generating narrative worlds poses many challenges. We identify some of these challenges and describe in more detail one of them: the impact of a story's temporal dimension, which introduces dynamic fluctuations of objects between locations over time.

### Talk 5: Breathing Life into Domain-Specific Languages
**Abstract.** Live programming is a technique to shorten the feedback loop between editing a program and its execution. For domain-specific languages (DSLs) the gap between the program and how it is executed at run time can be even bigger than for general purpose languages such as Java. In this short talk we will highlight the main challenges for bridging this gap and showcase early research results in breathing life into DSLs.
