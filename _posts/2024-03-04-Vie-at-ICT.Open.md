[NWO ICT.Open](https://www.ictopen.nl) is the Dutch national conference on Information Technology.
This year, the event takes place on April 10--11 at the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht.
On Thursday April 11th, we will demonstrate [Vie](/Vie),
a visual programming evironment for creating simple 2D game protoypes.
Please find the title and abstract below. Come visit us at our stand.

### A Live Programming Tutorial that uses Game-Based Learning
Educating novices in the art of programming is a key challenge in computer science education. To make the learning experience more engaging and fun, we propose a combination of live programming and game based learning. Specifically, we introduce visual feedback, with every minor code change, for exploring the immediate effects.

We demonstrate Vie, a visual live programming environment for simultaneously prototyping and play testing a game’s mechanisms [1, 2]. Originally designed as a professional game design tool, we have now successfully applied Vie in a programming tutorial [3].

At the CWI open day, kids aged 8 to 14 engaged in exploratory programming using two design themes: a) recovering a lost bunny (Fig. 1) and b) preventing climate change. In this live demo at ICT.Open, participants of ICT Open can also try this tutorial, and experience its main goals: *“programming is fun; can be visual too; and is for everyone”*.
