The [SEN Symposum](https://www.sen-symposium.nl) is the
National Symposium on Software Engineering in The Netherlands.
At the symposium, I will give a short talk entitled ``Vie is A Game Changer''.
You can find the abstract below.
Here, I share a demo of a tutorial ([PDF](/assets/CWI_Open_Dag_2023_Opdrachten.pdf) in Dutch) showing the Lost Bunny example [3].
The video illustrates how novices can easily create a simple 2D game that is immediately playable. Below, I also share an English version of the demo. 
Please note, at this moment neither video includes audio. 
Read more about Vie [here](/Vie/).

### Abstract
Educating novices in the art of programming is a key challenge in software engineering education. To develop their skills, novices rely on feedback to understand the effects of gradual code changes. However, programming environments lack suitable mechanisms for perceiving how changes affect running programs. As a result, forming mental models about cause-and-effect relationships is hard, and learning how to program can be tedious and frustrating.
To make the learning experience more engaging and fun, we propose a combination of game-based learning and live programming. In particular, we study how to create visual programming environments and tutorials that: a) bring the code to life through game design and play; and b) introduce immediate feedback, with every minor code change, for exploring immediate effects.
We develop Vie, an app for prototyping and play testing a gameâ€™s mechanisms simultaneously [1, 2]. Originally designed as a professional game design tool, we have also successfully applied Vie in a programming tutorial [3]. At the CWI open day, kids aged 8 to 14 engaged in exploratory programming using two design themes: a) recovering a lost bunny; and b) preventing climate change.
Our work is still ongoing. We report initial experiences, describe preliminary insights, and reflect on the potential wider implications of our approach for future software engineering research.
