# Field Lab
We are opening our [website](https://CardGameDesign.github.io) on digital card game design and prototyping. We have begun our activities with a Field Lab funded by the Dutch Games Association (DGA) called *"A Digital Prototyping Tool for Card Game Design"*. A project description is available [here](https://fieldlab.dutchgamesassociation.nl/projects/digital-prototyping-tool/).

# Card Game Interest Group
While these are humble beginnings, we aim form a collective that unites designers, developers, researchers, students and lecturers with a common interest in digital card game design. Together we explore how to support and speed up design processes by developing and applying tools for digital card game prototyping.

# Activities
On this [website](https://CardGameDesign.github.io) we will share our progress, and organize future activities and collaborations.
