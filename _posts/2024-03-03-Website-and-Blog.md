Welcome to my new personal web site and blog. Here, I plan to communicate updates about my activities and results, e.g., on publications, talks and software.

**Maintenance.**
The goal is to keep the site's design simple and maintainable.
Using the Markdown notation, I can easily compose text and images, e.g., the icon on the right.
The site is entirely based on Jekyll, a Ruby-based static site generator.
GitHub pages, the site's host, offers a convenient way to add and maintain content.
For completeness, I have also archived blog posts that appear on project websites here.

**Design.**
The site consists of blog posts, like this one, and additional pages that can be accessed via the top menu.
The secondary menu under Research & Tools, is a ribbon of icons modeled after a talk
on *''Putting the PL into GamePLay''* at the Workshop on Programming Languages in The Netherlands (PLNL 2023).
In that talk, I summarized over 10 years of research in under 10 minutes.
