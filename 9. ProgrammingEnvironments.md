Programming grants individuals the capability to design, create, and bring ideas to life. To improve their skills, programmers require powerful languages and programming environments for understanding the impact of gradual code changes. We investigate how modern game engine technology, Godot in particular, can be leveraged for creating visual input and feedback mechanisms that drive exploratory and live programming.
