PuzzleScript is a programming language and online game engine 
with an active user community.
Created by Lavelle [1], this surprisingly concise and powerful notation
expresses mechanisms using rewrite rules that work on tile maps.
PuzzleScript has been used to recreate
many classic games such as Sokoban.
The availability of the soure code
of these games provides an
opportunity for empirical studies. 

**PuzzleScript.**
Games are tile maps populated by objects, named sprites of 5x5 pixel that can move and collide.
The game logic is a set of rewrite rules.
Programs consists of sections.
Play sets the rules in motion.

**Results.**
Our research on PuzzleScript has yielded the following results. 

* **PuzzleScript analyzer.**  Static analyzer by Mauro Vermeulen (Rascal + Salix) [2].

* **ScriptButler.** A novel tool for PuzzleScript analysis and mixed-initiative design by Clement Julia.
ScriptButler notably adds a PuzzleScript Grammar that enables parsing all PuzzleScript games in Rascal.
Using ScriptButler, we have performed an empirical study on the source code repository bundled with PuzzleScript [3, 4].

* **Tutomate.** A novel tool for automated playtesting of puzzle game tutorials by Dennis Vet [5, 6].

## Current and future work
**Tutorial generation.** Our current work focuses on analyzing game tutorials defined in PuzzleScript.
In addition, we combine automated playtesting with procedural level generation [7].
