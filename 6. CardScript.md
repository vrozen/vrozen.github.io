Card game creation is a powerful tool for game design.
Using playing cards, game designers can rapidly prototype and iteratively playtest a game's core mechanisms
to explore alternatives and improve the gameplay.
However, this process is time-consuming, imprecise and hard to steer and focus.
CardScript is an initiative to tackle these challenges
with unified game design language and toolset.

**DGA Field Lab.**
With a group of researchers and indie game developers,
we have conducted an applied research project,
a so-called Gaming Field Lab,
to investigate how to create such a toolset.
More information is available here: [https://cardgamedesign.github.io](https://cardgamedesign.github.io).

**Current and Future Work.**
We are continually looking for opportunities to continue this work,
e.g., together with game developers, research partners and students.

**Acknowledgements.**
A special thanks goes to Karel Millenaar (FourceLabs), the originator of the card game design project, who continues to be the best possible Game Design Envoy.
In addition, we thank Jori Kamp (Codeglue) and the participants of the workshops on card game design for their collaboration, input and feedback.
