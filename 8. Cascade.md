## Cascade
Live programming brings code to life with immediate and continuous feedback. To enjoy its benefits, programmers need powerful languages and live programming environments for understanding the effects of code modifications on running programs. 

**Cascade.** I have created enabling technology for creating these languages.
Cascade is a meta-language for expressing DSLs with input and feedback mechanisms that drive live programming.
Cascade is released under the 2-Clause BSD license.
